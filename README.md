# restAPI-practice

Rest API dev enviorment created using a combination of Node.js, Express & MongoDB to test the creating, deleting, and updated a subscriber database. All functions and packages including test enviroment were built and created from within VS Code using npm i and npm i --save-dev dotenv nodemon to install all the necessary npm packages. dotenv allows the user to pull in enviorment variables from a .env file and nodemon allows the user to refresh the server everytime changes are made without having to mannually end it and restart it.

A self created script from within the package.json file allows the user to run nodemon from which you can then create your own sever name as a javascript file in order to access it on your local host port once activated.
